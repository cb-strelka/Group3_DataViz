program game end


--- feature complete ---


add "depth to the game: more items and locations

    refactor code to make adding locations/drugs easier


Make game harder -- add chance
    implement price fluxuators- noisemap on top of the base changes for a location.

    random events?

change to be able to buy small amounts of goods instead of maxing out -- the noise will make people need to have fine grained control over stuff
